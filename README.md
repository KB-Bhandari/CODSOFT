During my internship at Codsoft, my initial project involved creating a number guessing game. 
The game required users to guess a randomly generated number within a limited number of attempts.
This project allowed me to apply Java programming concepts such as loops, conditional statements, and user input handling. 
It was a valuable learning experience in algorithmic thinking and user interaction design, emphasizing practical application within software development.

My second project was to develop a grade reporting system for students. 
This system involved calculating each student's total marks, computing their percentage based on predefined grading criteria, and assigning a grade according to their performance. 
Implementing this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java programming, particularly in data manipulation, calculation algorithms, and conditional logic. 

My third task was to develop an ATM machine simulation with user account functionalities. 
This project required implementing features for users to deposit funds, withdraw money, and check their account balances.
This project enabled me to gain practical experience in managing banking operations, ensuring transactional integrity, and providing a user-friendly interface for interacting with the ATM system.
